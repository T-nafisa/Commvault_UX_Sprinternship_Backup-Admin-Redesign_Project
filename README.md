# Commvault_UX_Sprinternship_Backup-Admin-Redesign_Project

This repository documents my UX design work completed during a
3-week full-time UX Sprinternship at Commvault.

The project focuses on improving the backup job monitoring
experience for enterprise backup administrators by reducing
cognitive load and making critical failures easier to identify.

## Project Scope
- Enterprise backup administration dashboard
- Job monitoring and failure investigation
- Priority and status signaling
- Admin-focused workflows

## Design Exploration
Two design approaches were explored for the same problem space:

- **Option A:** Inline priority highlighting for fast visual scanning
- **Option B:** Filter-driven prioritization for precise control

Both approaches address the same user needs with different
interaction strategies.

for portfolio purposes.
